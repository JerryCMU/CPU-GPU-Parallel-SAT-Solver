| Week | Items |
| ---- | ----- |
| Week 1 (11/7-11/13)  | Finish writing project proposal and setting up development environment |
| Week 2 (11/14-11/20) | Finish writing the sequential version of SAT Solver that will run on CPU. Parallelize the SAT solver on CPU with thread-level parallelism. |
| Week 3 (11/21-11/27) | Start writing the CUDA implementation of the SAT Solver. |
| Week 4 (11/28-12/4)  | Finish implementing CUDA version of the SAT Solver. |
| Week 5 (12/5-12/11)  | Finalize the code. Measure performance and write up final report. |
| Week 6 (12/12-12/18) | Final Presentation |
